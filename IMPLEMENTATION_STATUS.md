# ✅ Front Desk System - Implementation Status

## Overview
Both **Step 6 (Automatic Room Assignment)** and **Step 7 (Front Desk Upcoming Arrivals)** have been **fully implemented and integrated** into the system.

---

## ✅ Step 6: Automatic Room Assignment (Pre-Arrival)

### Implementation Location
**File:** `/backend/src/routes/roomBooking.routes.js` (Lines 507-582)

### What It Does
When a booking payment is confirmed, the system **automatically assigns a specific room** from `room_inventory` that matches:
- ✅ The `room_type` booked
- ✅ `available` status in room inventory
- ✅ `clean` condition in room_status_log
- ✅ Not already assigned to another active booking

### SQL Logic Implemented
```sql
-- Find available clean room
SELECT ri.inventory_id, ri.unit_number
FROM room_inventory ri
LEFT JOIN room_status_log rsl ON ri.inventory_id = rsl.inventory_id 
  AND rsl.log_id = (
    SELECT MAX(log_id) 
    FROM room_status_log 
    WHERE inventory_id = ri.inventory_id
  )
WHERE ri.room_type_id = ?
  AND ri.status = 'available'
  AND (rsl.cleanliness_status = 'clean' OR rsl.cleanliness_status IS NULL)
  AND ri.inventory_id NOT IN (
    SELECT inventory_id 
    FROM room_assignments 
    WHERE status IN ('assigned', 'checked_in')
  )
LIMIT 1;

-- Create assignment
INSERT INTO room_assignments (
  booking_id, 
  inventory_id, 
  assigned_by, 
  assigned_at,
  status
)
VALUES (?, ?, NULL, NOW(), 'assigned');

-- Update room status
UPDATE room_inventory
SET status = 'reserved', updated_at = NOW()
WHERE inventory_id = ?;
```

### Key Features
- ✅ **Automatic trigger:** Runs when payment is confirmed
- ✅ **Transaction safety:** All operations wrapped in database transaction
- ✅ **System assignment:** `assigned_by = NULL` indicates auto-assignment
- ✅ **Status updates:** Room status changes from `available` → `reserved`
- ✅ **Logging:** Console logs show assignment success/failure

### Testing
```bash
# Test by confirming a booking payment
POST /api/room-booking/payment/:transaction_id
{
  "payment_method": "credit_card",
  "payment_reference": "TEST123"
}

# Check console for:
# ✅ Auto-assigned room 205 to booking 1032
```

## ✅ Step 7: Front Desk View — "Upcoming Arrivals"

### Backend Implementation

#### API Endpoints
**File:** `/backend/src/routes/frontDesk.routes.js`

##### 1. Get Upcoming Arrivals
```

```

**Query Parameters:**
- `days` - Number of days to look ahead (default: 7)
- `date` - Specific date to check (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- `status` - Filter by booking status (confirmed, pre_registered, all)

**SQL Query:**
```sql
SELECT 
  b.booking_id,
  b.booking_reference,
  b.status as booking_status,
  b.payment_status,
  b.special_requests,
  rb.check_in_date,
  rb.check_out_date,
  rb.guest_name,
  rb.guest_email,
  rb.guest_phone,

  rt.type_name as room_type,
  h.name as homestay_name,
  ra.assignment_id,
  ra.status as assignment_status,
  ri.unit_number as assigned_room_number,
  ri.floor as assigned_room_floor,
  ri.status as room_status,
  COALESCE(
    (SELECT cleanliness_status 
     FROM room_status_log 
     WHERE inventory_id = ri.inventory_id 
     ORDER BY log_id DESC 
     LIMIT 1), 
    'unknown'
  ) as room_cleanliness,
  DATEDIFF(rb.check_in_date, CURDATE()) as days_until_arrival
FROM bookings b
INNER JOIN room_bookings rb ON b.booking_id = rb.booking_id
INNER JOIN room_inventory ri_booked ON rb.inventory_id = ri_booked.inventory_id
INNER JOIN room_types rt ON ri_booked.room_type_id = rt.room_type_id
INNER JOIN homestays h ON rb.homestay_id = h.homestay_id
LEFT JOIN room_assignments ra ON b.booking_id = ra.booking_id 
  AND ra.status IN ('assigned', 'checked_in')
LEFT JOIN room_inventory ri ON ra.inventory_id = ri.inventory_id
WHERE rb.check_in_date BETWEEN CURDATE() AND DATE_ADD(CURDATE(), INTERVAL ? DAY)
  AND b.status IN ('confirmed', 'pre_registered')
ORDER BY rb.check_in_date ASC, b.booking_id ASC;
```

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "total_arrivals": 5,
    "arrivals": [...],
    "grouped_by_date": {
      "2025-02-15": [...],
      "2025-02-16": [...]
    },
    "date_range": "Today + 7 days"
  }
}
```

##### 2. Get Today's Arrivals (Quick Access)
```
GET /api/front-desk/today-arrivals
```

##### 3. Check-In Guest
```

```

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "key_card_number": "KC-12345",
  "notes": "Guest requested early check-in"
}
```

**What It Does:**
- ✅ Updates `room_assignments.status` to `checked_in`

## 🧪 Testing Guide

### 1. Test Automatic Room Assignment

```bash
# Step 1: Create a booking (should be in 'pending' status)
POST /api/room-booking/create

# Step 2: Confirm payment (triggers auto-assignment)
POST /api/room-booking/payment/:transaction_id
{
  "payment_method": "credit_card",
  "payment_reference": "TEST123"
}

# Step 3: Check console logs for:
# ✅ Auto-assigned room 205 to booking 1032

# Step 4: Verify in database
SELECT * FROM room_assignments WHERE booking_id = 1032;
SELECT status FROM room_inventory WHERE inventory_id = 205;
# Should show: status = 'reserved'
```

### 2. Test Front Desk Dashboard

```bash
# Access the frontend
http://localhost:5173/frontdesk/upcoming-arrivals

# Test API directly
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3001/api/front-desk/upcoming-arrivals?days=7" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Test today's arrivals
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3001/api/front-desk/today-arrivals" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Test specific date
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3001/api/front-desk/upcoming-arrivals?date=2025-02-15" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### 3. Test Check-In Process

```bash
# Via API
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3001/api/front-desk/check-in/1032" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "key_card_number": "KC-12345",
    "notes": "Early check-in requested"
  }'

# Via Frontend
# 1. Navigate to Upcoming Arrivals page
# 2. Find a guest with "assigned" status
# 3. Click "Check In" button
# 4. Enter key card number
# 5. Submit
# 6. Verify status changes to "Checked In"
```
