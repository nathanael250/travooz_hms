# Front Desk System - Quick Test Guide

## ✅ System Status: FULLY OPERATIONAL

Both **Step 6 (Automatic Room Assignment)** and **Step 7 (Front Desk Upcoming Arrivals)** are **completely implemented** and ready to use.

---

## 🧪 Quick Verification Tests

### 1. Backend Server Status
```bash
# Check if backend is running
lsof -ti:3001
# ✅ Should return a process ID (e.g., 69049)

# Check if frontend is running
lsof -ti:5173
# ✅ Should return a process ID
```

### 2. Test Front Desk API (With Authentication)

#### Get Authentication Token First
```bash
# Login to get token
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3001/api/auth/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "your_email@example.com",
    "password": "your_password"
  }'

# Save the token from response
TOKEN="your_token_here"
```

#### Test Upcoming Arrivals Endpoint
```bash
# Get upcoming arrivals (next 7 days)
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3001/api/front-desk/upcoming-arrivals?days=7" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" | jq .

# Expected Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "total_arrivals": 5,
    "arrivals": [...],
    "grouped_by_date": {...},
    "date_range": "Today + 7 days"
  }
}
```

#### Test Today's Arrivals
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3001/api/front-desk/today-arrivals" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" | jq .
```

#### Test Specific Date
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3001/api/front-desk/upcoming-arrivals?date=2025-02-15" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" | jq .
```

### 3. Test Frontend Dashboard

#### Access the Page
```
http://localhost:5173/frontdesk/upcoming-arrivals
```

#### What You Should See
✅ Summary cards showing:
- Total arrivals
- Today's arrivals
- Rooms assigned
- Checked-in guests

✅ Filter controls:
- Date range selector (3, 7, 14, 30 days)
- Specific date picker
- Status filter dropdown

✅ Arrivals list grouped by date with:
- Guest information
- Room assignments

## 🔄 Test Complete Workflow

### Scenario: New Booking → Auto Assignment → Front Desk Check-In

#### Step 1: Create a Booking
```bash
# Create a new booking (via your booking system)
# This should create a booking in 'pending' status
```

#### Step 2: Confirm Payment (Triggers Auto-Assignment)
```bash
# Confirm payment for the booking
POST /api/room-booking/payment/:transaction_id
{
  "payment_method": "credit_card",
  "payment_reference": "TEST123"
}

# ✅ Check backend console logs for:
# "✅ Auto-assigned room 205 to booking 1032"
```

#### Step 3: Verify Auto-Assignment in Database
```sql
-- Check room assignment was created
SELECT * FROM room_assignments 
WHERE booking_id = 1032;

-- Expected result:
-- assignment_id | booking_id | inventory_id | assigned_by | status
-- 1            | 1032       | 205          | NULL        | assigned

-- Check room status was updated
SELECT inventory_id, unit_number, status 
FROM room_inventory 
WHERE inventory_id = 205;

-- Expected result:
-- inventory_id | unit_number | status
-- 205          | 205         | reserved
```

#### Step 4: View in Front Desk Dashboard
```
1. Navigate to: http://localhost:5173/frontdesk/upcoming-arrivals
2. Find the booking in the arrivals list
3. Verify:
   ✅ Guest name is displayed
   ✅ Room number shows "205"
   ✅ Status badge shows "Assigned"
   ✅ "Check In" button is visible
```

#### Step 5: Process Check-In
```
1. Click "Check In" button for the guest
2. Enter key card number (e.g., "KC-12345")
3. Add optional notes
4. Click "Check In Guest"
5. Verify:
   ✅ Success toast notification appears
   ✅ Status changes to "Checked In"
   ✅ Check-in button disappears
```

#### Step 6: Verify Check-In in Database
```sql
-- Check assignment status updated
SELECT assignment_id, status, checked_in_at, key_card_number
FROM room_assignments 
WHERE booking_id = 1032;

-- Expected result:
-- assignment_id | status      | checked_in_at       | key_card_number
-- 1            | checked_in  | 2025-02-15 14:30:00 | KC-12345

-- Check room status updated to occupied
SELECT inventory_id, unit_number, status 
FROM room_inventory 
WHERE inventory_id = 205;

-- Expected result:
-- inventory_id | unit_number | status
-- 205          | 205         | occupied
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Access denied. No token provided"
**Solution:** Make sure you're logged in and the token is included in the Authorization header.

### Issue: "No available clean rooms found"
**Possible Causes:**
1. All rooms of that type are already assigned
2. No rooms marked as 'clean' in room_status_log
3. All rooms are in 'occupied' or 'maintenance' status

**Solution:** 
```sql
-- Check available rooms
SELECT ri.inventory_id, ri.unit_number, ri.status, rsl.cleanliness_status
FROM room_inventory ri
LEFT JOIN room_status_log rsl ON ri.inventory_id = rsl.inventory_id
WHERE ri.room_type_id = 2
ORDER BY ri.inventory_id;

-- Update room status if needed
UPDATE room_inventory SET status = 'available' WHERE inventory_id = 205;

-- Add cleanliness log if needed
INSERT INTO room_status_log (inventory_id, cleanliness_status, logged_by, logged_at)
VALUES (205, 'clean', 1, NOW());
```

### Issue: Frontend shows "Failed to fetch upcoming arrivals"
**Possible Causes:**
1. Backend server not running
2. CORS issues
3. Authentication token expired

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check backend is running
lsof -ti:3001

# Check backend logs
# Look for error messages in the terminal running the backend

# Clear localStorage and login again
localStorage.clear();
# Then login again to get fresh token
```

### Issue: Check-in button doesn't work
**Possible Causes:**
1. Booking doesn't have a room assignment
2. Room already checked in
3. API endpoint error

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Check if assignment exists
SELECT * FROM room_assignments WHERE booking_id = 1032;

-- If no assignment, create one manually
INSERT INTO room_assignments (booking_id, inventory_id, assigned_by, assigned_at, status)
VALUES (1032, 205, 1, NOW(), 'assigned');
```

## 📊 Database Queries for Verification

### Check All Upcoming Arrivals
```sql
SELECT 
  b.booking_id,
  b.booking_reference,
  b.status as booking_status,
  rb.check_in_date,
  rb.guest_name,
  rt.type_name as room_type,
  ra.status as assignment_status,
  ri.unit_number as assigned_room
FROM bookings b
INNER JOIN room_bookings rb ON b.booking_id = rb.booking_id
INNER JOIN room_inventory ri_booked ON rb.inventory_id = ri_booked.inventory_id
INNER JOIN room_types rt ON ri_booked.room_type_id = rt.room_type_id
LEFT JOIN room_assignments ra ON b.booking_id = ra.booking_id
LEFT JOIN room_inventory ri ON ra.inventory_id = ri.inventory_id
WHERE rb.check_in_date >= CURDATE()
  AND b.status IN ('confirmed', 'pre_registered')
ORDER BY rb.check_in_date ASC;
```

### Check Room Assignment Status
```sql
SELECT 
  ra.assignment_id,
  ra.booking_id,
  b.booking_reference,

  ra.checked_in_at,
  ra.key_card_number
FROM room_assignments ra
INNER JOIN bookings b ON ra.booking_id = b.booking_id
INNER JOIN room_inventory ri ON ra.inventory_id = ri.inventory_id
WHERE ra.status IN ('assigned', 'checked_in')
ORDER BY ra.assigned_at DESC;
```

### Check Available Rooms
```sql
SELECT 
  ri.inventory_id,
  ri.unit_number,
  ri.floor,
  rt.type_name,
  ri.status,
  COALESCE(
    (SELECT cleanliness_status 
     FROM room_status_log 
     WHERE inventory_id = ri.inventory_id 
     ORDER BY log_id DESC 
     LIMIT 1), 
    'unknown'
  ) as cleanliness
FROM room_inventory ri
INNER JOIN room_types rt ON ri.room_type_id = rt.room_type_id
WHERE ri.status = 'available'
ORDER BY rt.type_name, ri.unit_number;
```
