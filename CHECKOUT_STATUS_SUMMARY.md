# Check-Out Feature - Status Summary

## ✅ PRIMARY REQUIREMENT: VERIFIED

**[ ✅ ] Hotel manager can view all check-outs**

---

## Quick Answer

**Yes, hotel managers can view all check-outs for their assigned hotel.**

The system is fully configured with:
- ✅ Proper role-based access control (manager role)
- ✅ Protected API endpoints
- ✅ Multi-hotel support
- ✅ Real data display (no dummy data)
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling

---

## How It Works (30-Second Overview)

1. **Manager logs in** → System issues JWT token with userType='hms'
2. **Manager navigates** → Clicks "Front Desk" → "Check-Out" menu
3. **Component loads** → Fetches from `GET /api/front-desk/checkouts`
4. **API validates** → Confirms user is active with assigned_hotel_id
5. **Data filtered** → Returns only check-outs for manager's hotel
6. **Display shown** → Manager sees list of pending/due check-outs

### 2. Dummy Data Removal
- **Problem:** Mock data masked real API issues
