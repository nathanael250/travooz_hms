# Invoice Generation System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
A complete invoice generation and management system has been implemented for the Travooz Hotel Management System (HMS). The system allows generating invoices for bookings that include room charges, booking charges (minibar, laundry, etc.), and restaurant orders.

---

## Backend Implementation

### 1. Invoice Routes (`/backend/src/routes/invoice.routes.js`)

#### Endpoints Implemented:

**POST /api/invoices/generate/:booking_id**
- Generates a complete invoice for a booking
- Aggregates charges from multiple sources:
  - Room charges (calculated from check-in/check-out dates and room rates)
  - Booking charges (minibar, laundry, phone, parking, etc.)
  - Restaurant orders (all menu items ordered during the stay)
- Generates unique invoice number format: `INV-YYYYMM-XXXX`
- Calculates subtotal, tax (18% VAT default), service charge, and discounts
- Creates invoice record and all line items in a database transaction
- Returns complete invoice with all items

**GET /api/invoices**
- Lists all invoices with filtering options
- Supports filters: status, homestay_id, date range, search term
- Includes guest and homestay information
- Pagination support with limit and offset
- Searches across invoice number, booking reference, and guest names

**GET /api/invoices/:invoice_id**
- Retrieves single invoice with full details
- Returns complete invoice with guest, homestay, and room information

- Provides all data needed for invoice display and PDF generation

**PATCH /api/invoices/:invoice_id/status**
- Updates invoice status
- Validates status values (draft, sent, paid, partially_paid, overdue, cancelled)

- Automatically sets paid_at timestamp when status changes to 'paid'

**POST /api/invoices/:invoice_id/payment**
- Records payment against an invoice
- Updates amount_paid and balance_due
- Automatically adjusts status based on payment:
  - balance_due = 0 → status = 'paid'
  - amount_paid > 0 but balance_due > 0 → status = 'partially_paid'
- Uses database transactions for data integrity
- Sets paid_at timestamp when fully paid

**DELETE /api/invoices/:invoice_id**
- Deletes draft invoices only

- Professional invoice layout with:
  - Company/homestay header
  - Invoice number and dates
  - Bill-to information
  - Booking details
  - Itemized charges table
  - Subtotal, tax, service charge, discounts
  - Total amount, amount paid, balance due
  - Notes and payment terms

app.use('/api/invoices', authMiddleware, invoiceRoutes);
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Invoice Number Generation
- Format: `INV-YYYYMM-XXXX`
- Example: `INV-202401-0001`
- Sequential numbering within each month
- Prevents number exhaustion
- Easy to organize and search

### Charge Aggregation Logic
The system intelligently pulls charges from three sources:

1. **Room Charges:**
   - Calculates nights stayed from check-in/check-out dates
   - Multiplies by room rate
   - Added as line item: "Room Charges - [Room Number] ([Room Type])"

2. **Booking Charges:**
   - Queries booking_charges table
   - Each charge type (minibar, laundry, phone, parking, etc.) added as separate line item
   - Format: "[Charge Type] - [Description]"

3. **Restaurant Orders:**
   - Queries restaurant_orders and restaurant_order_items tables
   - Filters by booking_id
   - Each menu item added as separate line item
   - Format: "[Menu Item Name] x [Quantity]"

### Tax Calculation
- Default tax rate: 18% (VAT)
- Configurable per invoice
- Applied to subtotal
- Displayed separately on invoice

### Payment Tracking
- Supports partial payments
- Automatically updates status:
  - `paid` when balance_due = 0
  - `partially_paid` when amount_paid > 0 but balance_due > 0
- Tracks payment date (paid_at)
- Can record multiple payments (extensible to payments table)

### Data Integrity
- All multi-step operations use database transactions
- Automatic rollback on errors
- Prevents duplicate invoices for same booking
- Validates invoice status before deletion
- Parameterized queries prevent SQL injection

## Support and Maintenance

### Common Issues:

**Invoice not generating:**
- Check if invoice already exists for booking
- Verify booking has valid guest_id and homestay_id
- Check database connection

**Email not sending:**
- Verify SMTP credentials in .env
- Check SMTP server allows connections
- For Gmail, use App Password

**PDF not downloading:**
- Check browser popup blocker
- Verify backend route is accessible
- Check console for errors

### Database Maintenance:

**Clean up old draft invoices:**
```sql
DELETE FROM invoice_items WHERE invoice_id IN (
  SELECT invoice_id FROM invoices 
  WHERE status = 'draft' AND created_at < DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)
);

DELETE FROM invoices 
WHERE status = 'draft' AND created_at < DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 30 DAY);
```

**Update overdue invoices:**
```sql
UPDATE invoices 
SET status = 'overdue' 
WHERE status IN ('sent', 'partially_paid') 
  AND due_date < CURDATE() 
  AND balance_due > 0;
```
