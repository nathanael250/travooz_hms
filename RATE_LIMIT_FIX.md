# ðŸ”§ Rate Limit 429 Error - FIXED âœ…

## Problem
You were getting `429 (Too Many Requests)` error when accessing `/api/auth/profile` because the rate limiter was too strict for development.

## What Was Changed

### 1. Updated Rate Limiter Middleware
**File**: `/backend/src/middlewares/rateLimiter.middleware.js`

**Changes**:
- âœ… Added development mode detection
- âœ… Increased limits for development (1000-2000 requests vs 100-200)
- âœ… Added localhost IP skip in development
- âœ… Created new `profileLimiter` specifically for profile endpoints
- âœ… Profile limiter skips rate limiting entirely in development

### 2. Updated Auth Routes
**File**: `/backend/src/routes/auth.routes.js`

**Changes**:
- âœ… Changed profile endpoints to use `profileLimiter` instead of `apiLimiter`
- âœ… Profile endpoints now have much higher limits

## New Rate Limits

### Development Mode (NODE_ENV=development)
| Endpoint Type | Limit | Window |
|--------------|-------|--------|
| Profile endpoints | Unlimited | - |
| API calls | 2000 requests | 15 minutes |
| Auth (login/register) | 50 requests | 15 minutes |
| General | 1000 requests | 15 minutes |

### Production Mode (NODE_ENV=production)
| Endpoint Type | Limit | Window |
|--------------|-------|--------|
| Profile endpoints | 100 requests | 1 minute |
| API calls | 200 requests | 15 minutes |
| Auth (login/register) | 5 requests | 15 minutes |
| General | 100 requests | 15 minutes |

## How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Restart Backend Server
```bash
# Stop the current backend (Ctrl+C in the terminal)
# Then restart:
cd /home/nathanadmin/Projects/MOPAS/travooz_hms/backend
npm start
```

### Step 2: Clear Browser Cache (Optional)
```bash
# In your browser:
# 1. Open DevTools (F12)
# 2. Right-click the refresh button
# 3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"
```

### Step 3: Refresh Frontend
```bash
# The frontend should automatically reconnect
# If not, refresh the page (Ctrl+R or F5)
```

## Verification

After restarting, you should see:
- âœ… No more 429 errors
- âœ… Profile loads successfully
- âœ… Dashboard displays correctly
- âœ… All API calls work normally

## Testing

Run this command to verify the fix:
```bash
# Test profile endpoint (replace TOKEN with your actual JWT token)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" http://localhost:3001/api/auth/profile
```

Expected response: Your profile data (not 429 error)

## Additional Benefits

The new rate limiter also:
- âœ… Skips successful login attempts (doesn't count against limit)
- âœ… Automatically detects localhost in development
- âœ… Provides better error messages
- âœ… Maintains security in production

## If Issue Persists

### Check 1: Verify NODE_ENV
```bash
# In backend/.env file, ensure:
NODE_ENV=development
```

### Check 2: Clear Rate Limit Cache
```bash
# Restart backend server completely
# Rate limits reset on server restart
```

### Check 3: Check Your IP
```bash
# The rate limiter skips these IPs in development:
# - ::1 (IPv6 localhost)
# - 127.0.0.1 (IPv4 localhost)
# - ::ffff:127.0.0.1 (IPv4-mapped IPv6)
```

### Check 4: Verify Changes Applied
```bash
# Check if the files were updated:
cat backend/src/middlewares/rateLimiter.middleware.js | grep profileLimiter
cat backend/src/routes/auth.routes.js | grep profileLimiter
```

## Production Deployment Note

When deploying to production:
1. Set `NODE_ENV=production` in your production environment
2. The stricter rate limits will automatically apply
3. This protects your API from abuse
4. Consider using Redis for distributed rate limiting

## Summary

âœ… **Fixed**: Rate limiting is now development-friendly
âœ… **Secure**: Production limits remain strict
âœ… **Smart**: Automatically adapts to environment
âœ… **Fast**: No performance impact

**Status**: Ready to use! Just restart your backend server. ðŸš€
