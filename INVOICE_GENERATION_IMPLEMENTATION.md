## ‚úÖ Implementation Status: COMPLETE

All invoice generation functionality has been successfully implemented for the receptionist front desk interface.

---

## üìã Part 1: Backend Implementation

### 1.1 Invoice Service (`/backend/src/services/invoiceService.js`)

**Purpose:** Centralized business logic for invoice operations with intelligent charge aggregation

#### Key Functions:

**`aggregateChargesForBooking(bookingId)`**
- Aggregates all charges from multiple sources:
  - Room charges from `room_bookings`
  - Booking charges from `booking_charges` (minibar, services)
  - Restaurant orders from `hotel_order_items`
  - Guest requests from `guest_requests` (laundry, special services)
- Returns: Object with booking info, nights stayed, invoice items, and subtotal
- Normalizes different charge types into uniform invoice item format

**`generateInvoiceNumber()`**
- Creates sequential invoice numbers with format: `INV-YYYYMM-XXXX`
- Ensures uniqueness within same month
- Returns: Invoice number string

**`createInvoice(params)`**
- Transactional invoice creation (atomic operation)
- Parameters:
  - `bookingId`: Target booking
  - `taxRate`: Tax percentage (default: 18%)
  - `serviceChargeRate`: Service charge percentage (default: 0%)
  - `discountAmount`: Fixed discount (default: 0)
  - `paymentTerms`: Payment terms text (default: "Due on receipt")
  - `notes`: Invoice notes
  - `generatedBy`: User ID of creator
- Returns: Complete invoice object with items
- Error handling:
  - Prevents duplicate invoices
  - Transactional rollback on failure

### 1.2 Receptionist Controller Endpoints

#### Endpoint 1: GET `/api/receptionist/invoices/preview/:booking_id`

**Purpose:** Preview invoice before creation (allows verification of charges)

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "booking": {
      "booking_id": 123,
      "booking_reference": "BK-2024-001",
      "guest_name": "Guest Name",
      "check_in_date": "2024-01-10",
      "check_out_date": "2024-01-15",
      "homestay_name": "Hotel Name",
      "room_number": "203"
    },
    "nights": 5,
    "items": [
      {
        "description": "Room 203 - Standard (5 nights)",
        "quantity": 5,
        "unit_price": 50,
        "total_price": 250,
        "category": "room"
      },
      {
        "description": "Restaurant - Dinner",
        "quantity": 1,
        "unit_price": 30,
        "total_price": 30,
        "category": "restaurant"
      }
    ],
    "summary": {
      "subtotal": 280,
      "tax_amount": 50.4,
      "service_charge": 0,
      "discount_amount": 0,
      "total_amount": 330.4,
      "balance_due": 330.4
    }
  }
}
```

**Security:** Multi-vendor - verifies booking belongs to user's property

---

**Purpose:** Create invoice with aggregated charges and store in database

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "tax_rate": 18,
  "service_charge_rate": 0,
  "discount_amount": 0,
  "payment_terms": "Due on receipt",
  "notes": "Optional notes"
}
```

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "success": true,

        "unit_price": 50,
        "total_price": 250,
        "tax_amount": 0
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Error Handling:**
- 400: Invoice already exists for this booking
- 403: User not authorized for this property
- 404: Booking not found
- 500: Server error

**Security:** Multi-vendor - enforces property-level access control

---

**3. Header Action Buttons**
- Added to guest folio header:
  - "Preview Invoice" button (purple) - calls preview endpoint
  - "Generate Invoice" button (blue) - opens generate modal
  - Existing: "Print" and "Email" buttons

---

## üîÑ Workflow: How It Works

### Step-by-Step User Flow:

1. **Receptionist selects a guest** from the in-house guests list
   - Folio loads with current charges and payments

2. **Receptionist clicks "Preview Invoice"**
   - System queries all charges from multiple sources
   - Preview modal displays what invoice will look like
   - Guest can verify all items, quantities, and totals

3. **Receptionist clicks "Proceed to Generate"**
   - Generate modal opens with default tax/discount options
   - Receptionist can adjust:
     - Tax rate if needed
     - Apply service charge
     - Apply discount
     - Set payment terms
     - Add notes

4. **Receptionist clicks "Generate Invoice"**
   - Backend creates invoice atomically (invoice + all items)
   - Generates sequential invoice number
   - Calculates final totals
   - Stores in database with status "draft"
   - Returns invoice to frontend

5. **Invoice is now in system**
   - Can be viewed in Financial > Invoices
   - Can be printed
   - Can have payments recorded
   - Can be emailed to guest

## üîê Security Features

### Multi-Vendor Access Control

Both endpoints enforce property-level isolation:

```javascript
// Verify user's authorized hotel
const targetHomestayId = await getHomestayIdForUser(user, userType);

// Verify booking belongs to user's property
if (booking.homestay_id !== targetHomestayId) {
  return res.status(403).json({ message: 'Not authorized' });
}
```

**Supported User Types:**
- Vendor users (from `users` table)
- HMS staff members (from `hms_users` table)

**Cross-Property Protection:**
- User cannot generate invoices for bookings in other properties
- Prevents data leakage between hotels

---

## üß™ Testing the Implementation

### Test Scenario:

1. **Start backend server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Test Preview Endpoint (Postman):**
   ```
   GET http://localhost:3000/api/receptionist/invoices/preview/123
   
   Headers:
   - Authorization: Bearer <token>
   ```

3. **Test Generate Endpoint (Postman):**
   ```
   POST http://localhost:3000/api/receptionist/invoices/generate/123
   
   Headers:
   - Authorization: Bearer <token>
   
   Body:
   {
     "tax_rate": 18,
     "service_charge_rate": 0,
     "discount_amount": 0,
     "payment_terms": "Due on receipt",
     "notes": "Test invoice"
   }
   ```

4. **Test Frontend:**
   - Navigate to Front Desk > Guest Folio
   - Select an in-house guest
   - Click "Preview Invoice"
   - Verify charges are displayed correctly
   - Click "Proceed to Generate"
   - Adjust tax/discount if needed
   - Click "Generate Invoice"
   - Should see success message

## üìä Charge Aggregation Logic

### Room Charges
- Fetches from `room_bookings`
- Calculates: nights √ó rate
- Example: 5 nights √ó 50 = 250

### Restaurant Orders
- Fetches from `hotel_order_items` (linked to booking)
- Calculates per item: quantity √ó price
- Groups items with restaurant category

### Guest Requests (Laundry, etc.)
- Fetches from `guest_requests` with charges > 0
- Groups by request_type
- Calculates: sum of charges per type

### Booking Charges (Minibar, etc.)
- Fetches from `booking_charges` table
- Already has total_amount calculated
- Includes tax_amount if applicable

### Final Calculation
```
Subtotal = sum of all items
Tax = subtotal √ó (tax_rate / 100)
Service Charge = subtotal √ó (service_charge_rate / 100)
Discount = provided discount_amount
Total = subtotal + tax + service_charge - discount
Balance Due = total - amount_paid
```
