## üß™ Testing the Feature

1. **Start the backend server**:
   ```bash
   cd /home/nathanadmin/Projects/MOPAS/travooz_hms/backend
   npm start
   ```

2. **Start the frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd /home/nathanadmin/Projects/MOPAS/travooz_hms/frontend
   npm start
   ```

3. **Navigate to the homestay**:
   - Go to: `http://localhost:3000/hotels/homestays/1`
   - This will show the Urugero Hotel details page

4. **Open Stay View**:
   - Click the blue **"Stay View"** button (with calendar icon)
   - You'll see the timeline with all bookings

5. **Test interactions**:
   - Click on any booking bar to see detailed information
   - Use Previous/Next buttons to navigate through dates
   - Click "Today" to jump back to the current date
   - Scroll horizontally to see more dates

## üîç Verification Queries

After loading the data, you can verify it with these SQL queries:

```sql
-- Check room types
SELECT * FROM room_types WHERE homestay_id = 1;

-- Check room inventory
SELECT * FROM room_inventory 
WHERE room_type_id IN (SELECT room_type_id FROM room_types WHERE homestay_id = 1);

-- Check bookings
SELECT * FROM bookings WHERE booking_id BETWEEN 100 AND 115;

-- Check room bookings with details
SELECT 
    rb.booking_id,
    b.booking_reference,
    b.status,
    rb.guest_name,
    ri.unit_number as room_number,
    rb.check_in_date,
    rb.check_out_date,
    rb.nights
FROM room_bookings rb
JOIN bookings b ON rb.booking_id = b.booking_id
JOIN room_inventory ri ON rb.inventory_id = ri.inventory_id
WHERE rb.booking_id BETWEEN 100 AND 115
ORDER BY rb.check_in_date;
```

## üóëÔ∏è Cleaning Up Test Data

If you want to remove the test data:

```sql
-- Remove room bookings
DELETE FROM room_bookings WHERE booking_id BETWEEN 100 AND 115;

-- Remove bookings
DELETE FROM bookings WHERE booking_id BETWEEN 100 AND 115;

-- Remove room inventory
DELETE FROM room_inventory WHERE inventory_id BETWEEN 1 AND 12;

-- Remove room types
DELETE FROM room_types WHERE room_type_id BETWEEN 1 AND 5;
```

## üìù Notes

- The test data uses **homestay_id = 1** (Urugero Hotel)
- All dates are relative to `CURDATE()` so the data remains relevant
- Guest information is fictional but realistic
- Booking references follow the pattern: `TRV-000100` to `TRV-000115`
- All prices are in Rwandan Francs (RWF)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Duplicate Key Errors
If you get duplicate key errors, it means the data already exists. You can either:
1. Clean up existing data first (see "Cleaning Up Test Data" section)
2. Modify the IDs in the SQL file

### Foreign Key Constraint Errors
Ensure that:
- The homestay with `homestay_id = 1` exists
- The user with `user_id = 4` exists
- The vendor with `vendor_id = 2` exists

### Data Not Showing in Stay View
Check:
1. Backend server is running
2. Frontend is running
3. You're logged in as the vendor who owns the homestay
4. The API endpoint `/api/homestays/1/stay-view` is accessible

## üìû Support

If you encounter any issues with the test data, please check:
1. Database connection settings
2. Table structures match the schema
3. All required parent records exist
4. MySQL user has proper permissions
