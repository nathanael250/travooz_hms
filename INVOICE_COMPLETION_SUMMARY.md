## System Integration

### How It Works

1. **Invoice Generation Flow:**
   - User clicks invoice icon on booking (checked-in, checked-out, or completed)
   - System checks for existing invoice (prevents duplicates)
   - Fetches all booking-related charges
   - Calculates totals with tax
   - Generates unique invoice number
   - Saves invoice and line items
   - Displays invoice to user

2. **PDF Download Flow:**
   - User clicks Download button
   - Backend generates PDF using PDFKit
   - PDF streams directly to browser
   - User can save or print

3. **Email Flow:**
   - User enters recipient email and optional message
   - Backend generates HTML email
   - Sends via configured SMTP server
   - Updates invoice status to "Sent"
   - Guest receives professional email with invoice details

4. **Payment Flow:**
   - User enters payment amount and details
   - System validates amount (cannot exceed balance)
   - Updates invoice payment amounts
   - Recalculates balance
   - Updates status (Paid or Partially Paid)

## Configuration Required

### Email Setup (Optional but Recommended)
Add to `/backend/.env`:
```env
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your-app-password
SMTP_FROM=noreply@travooz.com
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
```
