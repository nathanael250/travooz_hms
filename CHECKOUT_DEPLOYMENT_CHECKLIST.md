## 🧪 Testing Preparation

### Pre-Deployment Testing
- [ ] **Backend Tests**
  - [ ] Start backend server successfully
  - [ ] Check backend logs for startup errors
  - [ ] Verify database connection works
  - [ ] Test endpoint with Postman

- [ ] **Frontend Tests**
  - [ ] Start frontend dev server
  - [ ] Clear browser cache
  - [ ] Login successfully
  - [ ] Navigate to Bookings page

- [ ] **End-to-End Test**
  - [ ] Create test booking
  - [ ] Confirm booking
  - [ ] Assign room
  - [ ] Check-in guest
  - [ ] Verify status = "In-House"
  - [ ] Click check-out button
  - [ ] Fill check-out form
  - [ ] Confirm check-out
  - [ ] Verify status = "Checked Out"

### Database Verification
- [ ] Query booking status changed
- [ ] Query room status changed to 'cleaning'
- [ ] Query front_desk_logs entry created
- [ ] Query room_status_log entry created
- [ ] Query audit_logs entry created
- [ ] Verify all data is correct and complete

### Error Scenario Testing
- [ ] Check-out non-existent booking
- [ ] Check-out non-checked-in booking
- [ ] Check-out already checked-out booking
- [ ] Invalid form data (negative numbers)
- [ ] Empty required fields (if any)
- [ ] Network failure simulation

---

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Code Deployment
- [ ] Pull latest changes from repository
- [ ] Verify file changes:
  ```bash
  git diff --stat
  # Should show 3 files modified:
  # - backend/src/controllers/receptionist.controller.js
  # - backend/src/routes/receptionist.routes.js
  # - frontend/src/pages/frontdesk/BookingsList.jsx
  ```

### Step 2: Backend Deployment
- [ ] Stop existing backend server
  ```bash
  pkill -f "node server.js"
  ```
- [ ] Install any new dependencies (if needed)
  ```bash
  cd /backend && npm install
  ```
- [ ] Start backend with monitoring
  ```bash
  npm start > /tmp/backend.log 2>&1 &
  ```
- [ ] Wait 5 seconds for startup
- [ ] Verify no startup errors
  ```bash
  cat /tmp/backend.log | grep -i "error\|fail"
  ```

### Step 3: Frontend Deployment
- [ ] Option A: Build for production
  ```bash
  cd /frontend && npm run build
  # Deploy dist folder to web server
  ```
- [ ] Option B: Restart dev server (development only)
  ```bash
  # Clear cache and hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
  ```

### Step 4: Smoke Testing
- [ ] Access frontend: `http://localhost:5173`
- [ ] Login with receptionist account
- [ ] Navigate to Front Desk → Bookings
- [ ] Verify page loads without errors
- [ ] Verify check-out button visible for in-house bookings

## 🔍 Verification Tests

### Unit Test Scenarios
```javascript
✅ Test 1: checkOutGuest with valid data
✅ Test 2: checkOutGuest with missing optional fields
✅ Test 3: checkOutGuest with invalid booking ID
✅ Test 4: checkOutGuest with non-completed booking
✅ Test 5: Database transaction rollback on error
✅ Test 6: All three log tables populated
```

### Integration Test Scenarios
```javascript
✅ Test 1: Full booking lifecycle: create → confirm → assign → check-in → check-out
✅ Test 2: Check-out with all optional fields filled
✅ Test 3: Check-out with no optional fields
✅ Test 4: Multiple check-outs in sequence
✅ Test 5: Verify guest data consistency across updates
```

### UI/UX Test Scenarios
```javascript
✅ Test 1: Check-out button appears for 'completed' status
✅ Test 2: Check-out button hidden for other statuses
✅ Test 3: Modal opens and displays correctly
✅ Test 4: Form validation works
✅ Test 5: Success notification displays
✅ Test 6: Error notification displays
✅ Test 7: Modal closes after successful submission
✅ Test 8: Status badge updates in real-time
```
