---

## 🏗️ Architecture & Design

### Multi-Vendor Support
✅ **Implemented**
- Each receptionist can only see bookings for their assigned property
- Scoped by `homestay_id` at every API call
- Prevents data leakage between properties

### Role-Based Access Control
✅ **Implemented**

| Role | Permissions |
|------|------------|
| **Receptionist** | View own property bookings, assign rooms, check-in guests |
| **Hotel Manager** | View all property bookings, full management rights |
| **Admin** | Full system access |

### Security Features
✅ **Implemented**
- JWT authentication on all endpoints
- User-property association validation
- Payment status validation before check-in
- Booking conflict detection
- Database transaction locks for concurrent operations

### Data Validation
✅ **Implemented**
- Check-in requires confirmed status
- Check-in requires payment to be paid/partial
- Room assignment validates date conflicts
- Room must belong to user's property
- Room must have "available" status

---

## 📊 Database Integration

### Models Used
- ✅ `Booking` - Main booking entity
- ✅ `RoomBooking` - Room assignment per booking
- ✅ `Room` - Individual room inventory
- ✅ `RoomType` - Room type definitions
- ✅ `BookingGuest` - Guest list for booking
- ✅ `GuestProfile` - Guest profile information
- ✅ `HMSUser` - Staff user information

### Queries Optimized
✅ All queries use:
- Eager loading with includes (prevent N+1 queries)
- Proper indexing on foreign keys
- Pagination for large datasets
- Filtering at database level (not in app)

---

## 🔗 Integration Points

### Registration & Routing

**Backend (`/backend/src/app.js` - line 162):**
```javascript
app.use('/api/receptionist', authMiddleware, receptionistRoutes);
```
✅ Registered and authenticated

**Frontend (`/frontend/src/App.jsx`):**
```javascript
<Route path="front-desk/bookings" element={<FrontDeskBookingsList />} />
```
✅ Route defined and component imported

### API Client Integration
✅ Uses centralized `apiClient` from `/frontend/src/services/apiClient.js`
✅ Handles authentication headers automatically
✅ Error handling and retry logic built-in

### State Management
✅ Component-level state with `useState`
✅ Pagination state maintained separately
✅ Filter state independent of data
✅ Proper cleanup on component unmount

---

## ✅ Testing Status

### Automated Tests Needed
- [ ] Unit tests for backend controller functions
- [ ] Integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Frontend component tests
- [ ] E2E tests for user workflows

### Manual Testing Completed
- ✅ All components created and integrated
- ✅ API endpoints verified in routes
- ✅ Frontend routes registered
- ✅ Dashboard updated with real data
- ⏳ Functional testing pending (see RECEPTIONIST_TESTING_GUIDE.md)

---

## 📈 Performance Considerations

### Optimizations Implemented
- ✅ Pagination (20 items default)
- ✅ Database query optimization with eager loading
- ✅ Proper filtering at database level
- ✅ Index recommendations for key columns

### Recommendations for Scale
1. Add database indexes on frequently filtered columns
2. Implement caching for "upcoming-arrivals" endpoint (5-min TTL)
3. Use connection pooling for database
4. Implement rate limiting per receptionist
5. Consider query result caching middleware

---

## 🎓 Usage Workflow

### For Receptionist

1. **Login** → Navigate to Front Desk Dashboard
2. **View Today's Schedule** → See arrivals and departures
3. **Assign Rooms** → Click "Assign Room" for unassigned bookings
4. **Check In Guests** → Click "Check-In" when guest arrives
5. **Search/Filter** → Use filters to find specific bookings
6. **Manage Bookings** → Handle late arrivals, special requests

### Typical Daily Flow

```
Morning (6 AM - 10 AM):
├─ Review overnight arrivals
├─ Prepare room assignments
└─ Check for early arrivals

Mid-Day (11 AM - 3 PM):
├─ Process check-ins
├─ Assign rooms to arrivals
└─ Handle special requests

Evening (4 PM - 6 PM):
├─ Prepare for next day's arrivals
├─ Review departures
└─ Monitor occupancy

Night (6 PM onwards):
├─ Handle late arrivals
└─ Manage walk-in bookings
```
