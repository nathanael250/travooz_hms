# Room Availability System - Quick Summary

## ✅ What Was Done

### Problem Identified
You were getting empty availability data: `{"success": true, "data": {"availability": []}}`

**Root Cause:** The system was using a separate `room_availability` table that required manual population, but no data existed.

### Solution Implemented
Migrated to **view-based availability system** using existing `room_availability_view` which provides **real-time availability** calculated from actual bookings.

---

## 🎯 Key Changes

### 1. Backend Routes Updated
**File:** `/backend/src/routes/roomAvailability.routes.js`

**New Endpoints:**
- ✅ `GET /api/room-availability/calendar` - Get availability calendar
- ✅ `GET /api/room-availability/available-rooms` - Get only available rooms
- ✅ `GET /api/room-availability/room/:roomId` - Check specific room
- ✅ `POST /api/room-availability/check-availability` - Check multiple rooms
- ✅ `GET /api/room-availability/rooms` - Get all rooms list
- ✅ `GET /api/room-availability/summary` - Get status summary

**All endpoints are PUBLIC** - No authentication required for read operations.

### 2. How It Works Now

```
┌─────────────────┐
│  room_bookings  │  ← Single source of truth
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ room_availability_view  │  ← Calculates availability in real-time
└────────┬────────────────┘
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│   API Endpoints │  ← Returns current availability
└─────────────────┘
```

**Availability Logic:**
- Room is **AVAILABLE** if no booking exists or booking doesn't overlap with requested dates
- Room is **RESERVED** if booking starts in the future
- Room is **OCCUPIED** if booking is currently active

## 📊 Your Current Data

Based on your database query:

```
Total Rooms: 9
├── Available: 3 rooms (104, 201, 202)
├── Reserved: 2 rooms (102, and others with future bookings)
└── Occupied: 4 rooms (101, 103, and others with active bookings)
```

**Room 101 Example:**
- Status: `occupied`
- Current Status: `reserved`
- Check-in: `2025-10-20`
- Check-out: `2025-10-23`

## 🧪 Testing

### Quick Test
```bash
# Test the availability API
curl "http://localhost:5000/api/room-availability/summary"
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "summary": {
      "available": 3,
      "reserved": 2,
      "occupied": 4,
      "total": 9
    }
  }
}
```

### Full Test Suite
```bash
./test-availability-view.sh
```

This runs 12 comprehensive tests covering all endpoints.

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Find Available Rooms for Dates
```bash
curl "http://localhost:5000/api/room-availability/available-rooms?start_date=2025-01-15&end_date=2025-01-20"
```

Returns all rooms that are available for January 15-20, 2025.

### Example 2: Check Specific Room
```bash
curl "http://localhost:5000/api/room-availability/room/4?start_date=2025-01-15&end_date=2025-01-20"
```

Checks if room #4 is available for those dates.

### Example 3: Get Calendar View
```bash
curl "http://localhost:5000/api/room-availability/calendar?start_date=2025-01-01&end_date=2025-01-31"
```

Returns availability for all rooms in January 2025.

### Example 4: Filter by Homestay
```bash
curl "http://localhost:5000/api/room-availability/available-rooms?start_date=2025-01-15&end_date=2025-01-20&homestay_id=1"
```

Returns available rooms only for homestay #1.

## 🎨 Frontend Integration

### Current Response Format

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "availability": [
      {
        "inventory_id": 4,
        "room_type_id": 8,
        "room_type": "Deluxe Room",
        "room_number": "104",
        "floor": "1",
        "room_status": "available",
        "current_status": "available",
        "check_in_date": null,
        "check_out_date": null,
        "homestay_id": 1,
        "homestay_name": "Sunset Villa",
        "base_price": 150.00,
        "max_occupancy": 2
      }
    ],
    "summary": {
      "total_rooms": 9,
      "available": 3,
      "reserved": 2,
      "occupied": 4
    }
  }
}
```

### Frontend Updates Needed

**File:** `/frontend/src/pages/hotels/RoomAvailability.jsx`

**Changes Required:**
1. Update data structure to match new response format
2. Display `current_status` instead of calculated availability
3. Show `check_in_date` and `check_out_date` for reserved/occupied rooms
4. Remove manual availability editing features (deprecated)
5. Add visual indicators for available/reserved/occupied status

---

## 🔄 Booking Flow Integration

### How Bookings Affect Availability

```
1. Guest searches for available rooms
   ↓
2. System queries room_availability_view
   ↓
3. Returns rooms with no overlapping bookings
   ↓
4. Guest selects room and creates booking
   ↓
5. Booking is inserted into room_bookings table
   ↓
6. room_availability_view automatically updates
   ↓
7. Room no longer appears in available rooms search
```

**No manual intervention needed!** The view automatically reflects booking changes.

---

## 🛠️ Maintenance

### To Close a Room Temporarily

**Don't use availability table.** Instead, update room status:

```sql
UPDATE room_inventory 
SET status = 'maintenance' 
WHERE inventory_id = 4;
```

The view will automatically exclude rooms with status other than 'available'.

### To View Current Bookings

```sql
SELECT * FROM room_availability_view 
WHERE current_status IN ('reserved', 'occupied');
```

### To Find Available Rooms Right Now

```sql
SELECT * FROM room_availability_view 
WHERE current_status = 'available'
GROUP BY inventory_id;
```

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### 1. No More Manual Availability Management
- Don't try to create availability records manually
- Availability is calculated automatically from bookings
- To make a room unavailable, create a booking or change room status

### 2. View Shows Multiple Rows Per Room
- If a room has multiple bookings, it appears multiple times in the view
- Use `GROUP BY inventory_id` to get unique rooms
- The API endpoints handle this automatically

### 3. Date Range Logic
- A room is available if booking doesn't overlap with requested dates
- Overlap means: `booking_start < search_end AND booking_end > search_start`
- No overlap means: `booking_end <= search_start OR booking_start >= search_end`

### 4. Public Access
- All GET endpoints are public (no authentication required)
- Guests can search for available rooms without logging in
- This is intentional for the booking flow

---

## 📞 Next Steps

1. **Test the API:**
   ```bash
   ./test-availability-view.sh
   ```

2. **Verify Data:**
   ```bash
   curl "http://localhost:5000/api/room-availability/summary"
   ```

3. **Update Frontend:**
   - Modify `RoomAvailability.jsx` to use new data structure
   - Remove availability editing features
   - Add booking status display

4. **Test Booking Flow:**
   - Search for available rooms
   - Create a booking
   - Verify room no longer appears as available
