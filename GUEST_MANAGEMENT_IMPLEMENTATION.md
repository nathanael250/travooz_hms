## 🎨 UI Pattern to Follow

All components follow the same pattern as `Accounts.jsx` and `GuestProfiles.jsx`:
1. Statistics cards at the top
2. Filters and search bar
3. Data table with actions
4. Modal for create/edit
5. Details modal for viewing full information

## 🔧 Integration Notes

- All guest actions should be scoped by homestay_id where applicable
- Requests and complaints should trigger staff notifications (future enhancement)
- Reviews should be linked to bookings and rooms for context
- Favorites can be used to auto-suggest rooms or services during booking

## 🐛 Bug Fixes Applied

Fixed `homestays.map is not a function` error in `Accounts.jsx`:
- Added `Array.isArray(homestays)` check before calling `.map()`
- Applied to both filter dropdown and modal dropdown
