# Room Availability - Public Access Implementation

## 🎯 Overview

The Room Availability system has been updated to allow **public access** for viewing room availability while keeping management features protected for authenticated users only.

## 🔓 Access Control Strategy

### **Public Access (No Authentication Required)**
✅ View room availability calendar  
✅ Check specific room availability  
✅ Browse available rooms  
✅ Filter by homestay  
✅ View homestay information  

### **Protected Access (Authentication Required)**
🔒 Create/update room availability  
🔒 Bulk update availability  
🔒 Close/open rooms  
🔒 Delete availability records  

---

## 📝 Changes Made

### 1. **Backend Routes** (`/backend/src/routes/roomAvailability.routes.js`)

#### Added Authentication Middleware Import:
```javascript
const authMiddleware = require('../middlewares/auth.middleware');
```

#### Protected Write Operations:
- `POST /api/room-availability` - Create/update single date (Protected)
- `POST /api/room-availability/bulk` - Bulk update (Protected)
- `PATCH /api/room-availability/toggle-closed` - Close/open room (Protected)
- `DELETE /api/room-availability/:id` - Delete record (Protected)

#### Public Read Operations:
- `GET /api/room-availability/calendar` - View availability calendar (Public)
- `GET /api/room-availability/room/:roomId` - View specific room (Public)
- `GET /api/room-availability/rooms` - List all rooms (Public)

### 2. **Backend App Configuration** (`/backend/src/app.js`)

**Before:**
```javascript
app.use('/api/room-availability', authMiddleware, roomAvailabilityRoutes);
```

**After:**
```javascript
app.use('/api/room-availability', roomAvailabilityRoutes); // Public read, protected write
```

The authentication is now handled at the route level instead of globally.

### 3. **Frontend Component** (`/frontend/src/pages/hotels/RoomAvailability.jsx`)

#### Added Authentication State:
```javascript
const [isAuthenticated, setIsAuthenticated] = useState(false);

useEffect(() => {
  const token = localStorage.getItem('hms_token');
  setIsAuthenticated(!!token);
}, []);
```

#### Updated API Calls to Support Optional Authentication:
```javascript
const headers = {
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
};

// Add token if available (for authenticated users)
if (token) {
  headers['Authorization'] = `Bearer ${token}`;
}
```

#### Conditional UI Elements:
- "Set Availability" button only shows for authenticated users
- Calendar cells are clickable only for authenticated users
- Visual feedback (cursor style) changes based on authentication status

## 🧪 Testing

### **Test as Guest (Unauthenticated)**

1. **Open browser in incognito/private mode**
2. **Navigate to:** `http://localhost:3000/hotels/room-availability`
3. **Expected behavior:**
   - ✅ Can view room availability calendar
   - ✅ Can switch between month and calendar views
   - ✅ Can filter by homestay
   - ✅ Can navigate between months
   - ✅ Can see color-coded availability status
   - ❌ Cannot see "Set Availability" button
   - ❌ Cannot click on calendar cells to edit

### **Test as Authenticated User**

1. **Login to the system**
2. **Navigate to:** `http://localhost:3000/hotels/room-availability`
3. **Expected behavior:**
   - ✅ All guest features above
   - ✅ Can see "Set Availability" button
   - ✅ Can click "Set Availability" to open modal
   - ✅ Can create/update availability
   - ✅ Can perform bulk updates
   - ✅ Can close/open rooms

### **API Testing**

#### Public Endpoints (No Token Required):

```bash
# Get availability calendar
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3001/api/room-availability/calendar?start_date=2024-01-01&end_date=2024-01-31"

# Get specific room availability
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3001/api/room-availability/room/1?start_date=2024-01-01&end_date=2024-01-31"

# Get rooms list
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3001/api/room-availability/rooms"

# Get homestays
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3001/api/homestays"
```

**Expected:** All should return `200 OK` with data

#### Protected Endpoints (Token Required):

```bash
# Try to create availability without token
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3001/api/room-availability" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "inventory_id": 1,
    "date": "2024-01-15",
    "available_units": 1,
    "total_units": 1
  }'
```

**Expected:** `401 Unauthorized` or `403 Forbidden`

```bash
# Create availability with token
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3001/api/room-availability" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "inventory_id": 1,
    "date": "2024-01-15",
    "available_units": 1,
    "total_units": 1
  }'
```

**Expected:** `201 Created` with success response

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### ✅ **What's Protected:**
1. **Data Modification** - Only authenticated users can create, update, or delete availability
2. **Sensitive Operations** - Closing rooms, bulk updates require authentication
3. **Business Logic** - Pricing and internal notes remain protected

### ✅ **What's Public:**
1. **Read-Only Data** - Guests can only view availability, not modify
2. **Essential Information** - Room numbers, availability status, dates
3. **No Sensitive Data** - Pricing, internal notes, and management features are hidden

### 🛡️ **Additional Security Measures:**
- Rate limiting still applies to all endpoints
- CORS configured for allowed origins only
- Input validation on all endpoints
- SQL injection protection via parameterized queries
- XSS protection via helmet middleware

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Test all public endpoints without authentication
- [ ] Test all protected endpoints with authentication
- [ ] Verify protected endpoints reject unauthenticated requests
- [ ] Test frontend as guest user (incognito mode)
- [ ] Test frontend as authenticated user
- [ ] Verify rate limiting is working
- [ ] Check CORS configuration for production domain
- [ ] Review security headers (helmet configuration)
- [ ] Test on mobile devices (responsive design)
- [ ] Monitor API logs for unauthorized access attempts

## 🔄 Integration with Booking Flow

The public room availability system integrates seamlessly with the booking process:

1. **Guest browses availability** (Public)
   - Views available rooms and dates
   - Filters by homestay and preferences

2. **Guest selects room and dates** (Public)
   - Checks availability for specific dates
   - Views room details

3. **Guest proceeds to booking** (May require authentication)
   - Creates guest profile (if new)
   - Submits booking request
   - Processes payment

4. **System updates availability** (Automatic)
   - Decrements available units
   - Updates room status
   - Creates housekeeping tasks

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Issue: Getting 401 Unauthorized on public endpoints**
**Solution:** Check that `authMiddleware` is removed from the route in `app.js`

### **Issue: "Set Availability" button not showing for logged-in users**
**Solution:** Verify token is stored in `localStorage` as `hms_token`

### **Issue: Can't create availability even when logged in**
**Solution:** Check that token is valid and not expired

### **Issue: CORS errors on public endpoints**
**Solution:** Verify frontend URL is in CORS allowed origins list
