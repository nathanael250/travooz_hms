# Fix Summary: Availability Endpoint Alignment

## üéØ Problem

**Your Issue:**
```
Availability Endpoint: Shows 1 room available (Room 202)
Booking Creation:     Rejects with "All 6 rooms are already booked"

Dates: 2025-12-01 to 2025-12-02
Room Type: Deluxe Room (room_type_id: 8)
```

**Root Cause:** The availability endpoint was using a flawed database view (`room_availability_view`) that only showed ONE booking per room, missing other overlapping bookings.

---

## ‚úÖ Solution Applied

### File Modified
**`/backend/src/routes/roomAvailability.routes.js`** (Lines 350-438)

### What Changed

**BEFORE (Incorrect):**
```javascript
// Used flawed view that only shows one booking per room
FROM room_availability_view rav
WHERE rav.current_status = "available"
  AND (rav.check_in_date IS NULL OR rav.check_out_date <= ? OR rav.check_in_date >= ?)
```

**AFTER (Correct):**
```javascript
// Direct query that checks ALL bookings for each room
FROM room_inventory ri
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM room_bookings rb
  INNER JOIN bookings b ON rb.booking_id = b.booking_id
  WHERE rb.inventory_id = ri.inventory_id
    AND b.status IN ('confirmed', 'pending', 'checked_in')
    AND rb.check_in_date < ?      -- Same logic as booking creation
    AND rb.check_out_date > ?     -- Same logic as booking creation
)
```

### Key Improvements

1. ‚úÖ **Checks ALL bookings** (not just one per room)
2. ‚úÖ **Uses same date overlap logic** as booking creation
3. ‚úÖ **Consistent results** between availability and booking endpoints
4. ‚úÖ **No false positives** (won't show available when actually booked)

## üß™ Testing

### Test Your Scenario

```bash
# 1. Check availability (should show 0 rooms)
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/room-availability/available-rooms?start_date=2025-12-01&end_date=2025-12-02&room_type_id=8"

# Expected: Empty array (no rooms available)
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "available_rooms": [],
    "count": 0
  }
}

# 2. Try to book (should also reject)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/room-bookings/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "room_type_id": 8,
    "check_in_date": "2025-12-01",
    "check_out_date": "2025-12-02",
    "guest_name": "Test User",
    "guest_email": "test@example.com",
    "guest_phone": "+250788123456",
    "number_of_adults": 2
  }'

# Expected: Rejection (all rooms booked)
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "No rooms available for Deluxe Room from 2025-12-01 to 2025-12-02. All 6 rooms are already booked."
}
```

‚úÖ **Both endpoints should now agree: No rooms available**

---

## üìä SQL Debugging

If you want to verify the data in your database:

```sql
-- 1. Check total rooms for room type 8
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_rooms
FROM room_inventory 
WHERE room_type_id = 8
  AND status IN ('available', 'occupied', 'reserved');

-- 2. Check overlapping bookings for Dec 01-02
SELECT 
  rb.inventory_id,
  ri.unit_number as room_number,
  rb.check_in_date,
  rb.check_out_date,
  b.status
FROM room_bookings rb
INNER JOIN bookings b ON rb.booking_id = b.booking_id
INNER JOIN room_inventory ri ON rb.inventory_id = ri.inventory_id
WHERE rb.room_type_id = 8
  AND b.status IN ('confirmed', 'pending', 'checked_in')
  AND rb.check_in_date < '2025-12-02'
  AND rb.check_out_date > '2025-12-01'
ORDER BY rb.inventory_id, rb.check_in_date;

-- Expected: Should show 6 bookings (one for each room)

-- 3. Check available rooms (should be empty)
SELECT 
  ri.inventory_id,
  ri.unit_number as room_number
FROM room_inventory ri
WHERE ri.room_type_id = 8
  AND ri.status IN ('available', 'occupied', 'reserved')
  AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM room_bookings rb
    INNER JOIN bookings b ON rb.booking_id = b.booking_id
    WHERE rb.inventory_id = ri.inventory_id
      AND b.status IN ('confirmed', 'pending', 'checked_in')
      AND rb.check_in_date < '2025-12-02'
      AND rb.check_out_date > '2025-12-01'
  );

-- Expected: Empty result (no available rooms)
```

## ‚ö° Performance Considerations

The new query uses a `NOT EXISTS` subquery. For optimal performance, ensure these indexes exist:

```sql
-- Check if indexes exist
SHOW INDEX FROM room_inventory WHERE Key_name LIKE 'idx_%';
SHOW INDEX FROM room_bookings WHERE Key_name LIKE 'idx_%';

-- Create if missing
CREATE INDEX idx_room_inventory_type_status ON room_inventory(room_type_id, status);
CREATE INDEX idx_room_bookings_inventory_dates ON room_bookings(inventory_id, check_in_date, check_out_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_status ON bookings(status);
```

---

## üîç Other Endpoints to Review

These endpoints also use `room_availability_view` and may need similar fixes:

1. `/api/room-availability/calendar`
2. `/api/room-availability/homestays/:homestay_id/rooms`
3. `/api/room-availability/rooms`
4. `/api/room-availability/rooms/:inventory_id`

**Recommendation:** Test these endpoints to see if they have similar issues.

---

## ‚úÖ Status

**FIXED** - The availability endpoint now uses the same date overlap logic as booking creation.

**Next Step:** Test with your actual data to confirm both endpoints return consistent results.

---

## üìñ Date Overlap Logic Reference

The standard formula used by both endpoints:

```
Two date ranges overlap if and only if:
  (range1_start < range2_end) AND (range1_end > range2_start)
```

**Examples for Dec 01-02 booking:**

| Existing Booking | Overlaps? |
|-----------------|-----------|
| Nov 30 to Dec 01 | ‚ùå NO (checkout = checkin allowed) |
| Nov 30 to Dec 02 | ‚úÖ YES |
| Dec 01 to Dec 02 | ‚úÖ YES |
| Dec 01 to Dec 03 | ‚úÖ YES |
| Dec 02 to Dec 05 | ‚ùå NO (checkout = checkin allowed) |

This allows **same-day turnover** (guest checks out Dec 01, new guest checks in Dec 01).
