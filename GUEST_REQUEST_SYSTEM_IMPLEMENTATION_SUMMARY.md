## 🔗 API Integration Examples

### Creating a Task from Receptionist

```javascript
const createRequest = async () => {
  const response = await apiClient.post('/guest-requests', {
    booking_id: 1,
    guest_id: 5,
    request_type: 'housekeeping',
    description: 'Need extra towels',
    priority: 'normal',
    assigned_to: 12,  // housekeeping_staff_id
    additional_charges: 0,
    notes: 'Guest requested soft towels'
  });
  // Task created and sent to staff
};
```

### Staff Accepting Task

```javascript
const acceptTask = async (taskId) => {
  const response = await apiClient.patch(
    `/guest-requests/${taskId}/accept`,
    { notes: 'Accepting this task now' }
  );
  // Status: pending → acknowledged
  // User can now start working
};
```

### Staff Completing Task

```javascript
const completeTask = async (taskId) => {
  const response = await apiClient.patch(
    `/guest-requests/${taskId}/complete`,
    {
      notes: 'Delivered 3 soft towels. Guest satisfied.',
      rating: 5,
      feedback: 'Guest was very happy'
    }
  );
  // Status: in_progress → completed
  // Task ready for billing
};
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Tasks not showing | Check hms_user_id matches assigned_to, verify homestay_id |
| Can't accept task | Verify task assigned to you, status is pending, you have auth |
| Charges missing from invoice | Verify task marked completed, additional_charges > 0, booking_id correct |
| Reassign not working | Feature fully implemented, may need endpoint update for persistence |
| Dashboard not loading | Check API token valid, network connection, browser console errors |
