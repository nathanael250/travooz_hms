## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: Can I generate multiple invoices for one booking?**
A: No, the system prevents duplicate invoices. Each booking can have only one invoice.

**Q: What if email sending fails?**
A: Check your SMTP configuration in `.env`. For Gmail, use App Passwords, not your regular password.

**Q: Can I customize the invoice template?**
A: Yes! Edit the PDF generation code in `/backend/src/routes/invoice.routes.js` (line ~535)

**Q: Can I delete an invoice?**
A: Only draft invoices can be deleted. Sent or paid invoices cannot be deleted for audit purposes.

**Q: How do I change the tax rate?**
A: The default is 18%. You can specify a different rate when generating the invoice via the API.
