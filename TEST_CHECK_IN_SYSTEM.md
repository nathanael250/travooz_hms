## End-to-End Testing Steps

### STEP 1: Setup Test Data
```bash
# Create a test booking and room assignment
# Instructions: Follow Booking Flow Test Guide
# Need: Homestay â†’ Room Type â†’ Room Inventory â†’ Booking â†’ Room Assignment
```

### STEP 2: Test Receptionist Check-In

**Access the application:**
```
1. Open http://localhost:5173 (Frontend)
2. Login as Receptionist
3. Navigate to Front Desk â†’ Upcoming Arrivals
4. View assigned guest for today or tomorrow
```

**Perform check-in:**
```
1. Find "upcoming arrival" card for test guest
2. Click "Check In" button (green button on card)
3. Modal appears with fields:
   - Key Card Number: Enter "KC-TEST-12345"
   - Notes: Enter "Test check-in - verification"
4. Click "Check In" button in modal
5. Should see success toast: "Guest checked in successfully!"
```

**Watch browser console for logs:**
```javascript
// You should see in browser console (F12 â†’ Console):
âœ… Processing check-in for booking: 123 with data: {
  key_card_number: "KC-TEST-12345",
  notes: "Test check-in - verification"
}

âœ… Check-in successful: {
  success: true,
  message: "Guest checked in successfully",
  data: {
    booking_id: 123,
    assignment_id: 456,
    guest_name: "Test Guest",
    room_number: "101",
    check_in_time: "2025-01-15T14:30:00.000Z",
    checked_in_by: 5
  }
}
```

### STEP 3: Verify Database Changes

#### Check Check-In Log Created
```sql
SELECT * FROM check_in_logs 
ORDER BY check_in_log_id DESC 
LIMIT 1;
```

**Expected Result:**
```
check_in_log_id | 1
booking_id      | 123
assignment_id   | 456
staff_id        | 5 (logged-in user)
guest_name      | Test Guest
room_number     | 101
check_in_time   | 2025-01-15 14:30:00
key_card_number | KC-TEST-12345
notes           | Test check-in - verification
homestay_id     | 1
created_at      | 2025-01-15 14:30:00
```

#### Check Audit Log Created
```sql
SELECT * FROM audit_logs 
WHERE action = 'CHECK_IN' 
ORDER BY log_id DESC 
LIMIT 1\G
```

**Expected Result:**
```
log_id      | 999
user_id     | 5 (staff member)
action      | CHECK_IN
table_name  | bookings
record_id   | 123
old_values  | {"status":"pre_registered","assignment_status":"assigned"}
new_values  | {"status":"checked_in","assignment_status":"checked_in","checked_in_by":5,"room_number":"101"}
ip_address  | 127.0.0.1 or similar
created_at  | 2025-01-15 14:30:00
```

#### Verify Booking Status Updated
```sql
SELECT booking_id, status, completed_at 
FROM bookings 
WHERE booking_id = 123;
```

**Expected Result:**
```
booking_id  | 123
status      | checked_in      âœ… (was: pre_registered)
completed_at| 2025-01-15 14:30:00
```

#### Verify Room Status Updated
```sql
SELECT inventory_id, unit_number, status 
FROM room_inventory 
WHERE inventory_id = 456;
```

**Expected Result:**
```
inventory_id | 456
unit_number  | 101
status       | occupied        âœ… (was: available or assigned)
```

#### Verify Room Assignment Updated
```sql
SELECT assignment_id, status, check_in_time, key_card_issued 
FROM room_assignments 
WHERE assignment_id = 456;
```

**Expected Result:**
```
assignment_id    | 456
status           | checked_in      âœ… (was: assigned)
check_in_time    | 2025-01-15 14:30:00
key_card_issued  | KC-TEST-12345
```

### STEP 4: Test Manager Reporting Endpoint

#### Using Postman or cURL

**Request:**
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3001/api/front-desk/check-in-logs?start_date=2025-01-15&end_date=2025-01-15&limit=10&offset=0" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "check_in_logs": [
      {
        "check_in_log_id": 1,
        "booking_id": 123,
        "guest_name": "Test Guest",
        "room_number": "101",
        "check_in_time": "2025-01-15 14:30:00",
        "key_card_number": "KC-TEST-12345",
        "notes": "Test check-in - verification",
        "staff_first_name": "Receptionist",
        "staff_last_name": "Name",
        "staff_email": "receptionist@hotel.com",
        "booking_reference": "BK-2025-001",
        "booking_status": "checked_in",
        "homestay_name": "Test Hotel"
      }
    ],
    "pagination": {
      "total": 1,
      "limit": 10,
      "offset": 0,
      "pages": 1
    }
  }
}
```

---

### STEP 5: Test Date Filtering

**Query with date range:**
```bash
# This week's check-ins
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3001/api/front-desk/check-in-logs?start_date=2025-01-13&end_date=2025-01-19" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

**Query with pagination:**
```bash
# Second page (50 records per page)
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3001/api/front-desk/check-in-logs?limit=50&offset=50" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Check-in button not working
**Solution:**
1. Clear browser cache: `Ctrl+Shift+Delete`
2. Refresh page: `F5`
3. Check browser console for errors: `F12`
4. Verify guest has room assigned: Check in room_assignments table
5. Check backend logs: `tail -f backend/logs/combined.log`

### Issue: Success message but no data in database
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if migration ran
mysql -h localhost -u admin -padmin travooz_hms -e "SHOW TABLES LIKE 'check_in_logs';"

# If table doesn't exist:
mysql -h localhost -u admin -padmin travooz_hms < backend/migrations/create_checkin_audit_table.sql
```

### Issue: Authorization error on manager endpoint
**Solution:**
1. Ensure user has `assigned_hotel_id` set
2. Check JWT token is valid: `Bearer YOUR_TOKEN`
3. Verify user has staff/manager role

### Issue: Booking status not changing
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if booking status enum includes 'checked_in'
mysql -h localhost -u admin -padmin travooz_hms -e "
SHOW COLUMNS FROM bookings LIKE 'status';
"

# Should show: checked_in in the Type
```

---

## Performance Verification

### Check Indexes Exist
```sql
SHOW INDEXES FROM check_in_logs;
```

**Expected Indexes:**
```
âœ… PRIMARY (check_in_log_id)
âœ… booking_id
âœ… staff_id
âœ… check_in_time
âœ… homestay_id
âœ… idx_check_in_logs_date (check_in_time DESC)
âœ… idx_check_in_logs_hotel (homestay_id, check_in_time DESC)
```

### Query Performance
```sql
-- Should be < 100ms
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM check_in_logs 
WHERE homestay_id = 1 
  AND check_in_time BETWEEN '2025-01-01' AND '2025-01-31'
ORDER BY check_in_time DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

---

## Multi-Vendor Isolation Test

### Test 1: Staff can only see their hotel's check-ins
```bash
# Login as staff for Hotel A
# Call GET /api/front-desk/check-in-logs
# Should only see check-ins from Hotel A âœ…

# Login as staff for Hotel B
# Call GET /api/front-desk/check-in-logs
# Should only see check-ins from Hotel B âœ…
```

### Test 2: Cross-hotel access denied
```bash
# Using Hotel A staff's token, try to modify Hotel B's room
# Should get 403 Forbidden response âœ…
```

---

## Security Verification

### Audit Trail Completeness
```sql
SELECT user_id, action, old_values, new_values, ip_address, created_at 
FROM audit_logs 
WHERE action = 'CHECK_IN' 
ORDER BY log_id DESC 
LIMIT 5;
```

**Verify:**
- âœ… user_id recorded (who did it)
- âœ… action is 'CHECK_IN'
- âœ… old_values shows previous state
- âœ… new_values shows new state
- âœ… ip_address recorded (where from)
- âœ… created_at timestamp (when)

### Authentication Required
```bash
# Try accessing endpoint WITHOUT token
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3001/api/front-desk/check-in-logs"

# Should get 401 Unauthorized âœ…
```

---

## Load Testing Simulation

### Generate 100 test check-ins
```sql
-- Only if needed for testing
INSERT INTO check_in_logs (booking_id, assignment_id, staff_id, guest_name, room_number, key_card_number, notes, homestay_id)
VALUES 
  (123, 456, 5, 'Test Guest 1', '101', 'KC-001', 'Test', 1),
  (124, 457, 5, 'Test Guest 2', '102', 'KC-002', 'Test', 1),
  (125, 458, 5, 'Test Guest 3', '103', 'KC-003', 'Test', 1);
  -- ... repeat 100 times
```

### Test pagination response time
```bash
curl -w "\nTotal time: %{time_total}s\n" \
  -X GET "http://localhost:3001/api/front-desk/check-in-logs?limit=50&offset=0" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Should respond in < 500ms âœ…
```
