## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Front Desk" menu not visible in sidebar
**Solution:**
- Clear browser cache and refresh
- Make sure you're logged in
- Check that the frontend server is running

### Issue: Page shows "Failed to fetch upcoming arrivals"
**Possible Causes:**
1. Backend server not running
2. Authentication token expired
3. CORS issues

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Check backend is running
lsof -ti:3001

# If not running, start it
cd /home/nathanadmin/Projects/MOPAS/travooz_hms/backend
npm run dev

# Clear localStorage and login again
# In browser console:
localStorage.clear();
# Then login again
```

### Issue: No arrivals showing
**Possible Causes:**
1. No bookings in the selected date range
2. All bookings are in 'pending' status (not confirmed)
3. Database has no data

**Solutions:**
```sql
-- Check if there are any confirmed bookings
SELECT b.booking_id, b.status, rb.check_in_date, rb.guest_name
FROM bookings b
INNER JOIN room_bookings rb ON b.booking_id = rb.booking_id
WHERE b.status IN ('confirmed', 'pre_registered')
AND rb.check_in_date >= CURDATE()
ORDER BY rb.check_in_date;

-- If no results, create a test booking or confirm an existing one
```

### Issue: Check-in button not appearing
**Requirements for check-in button to show:**
1. Guest must have a room assignment (`assignment_status = 'assigned'`)
2. Check-in date must be today (`days_until_arrival = 0`)
3. Guest must not already be checked in

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Verify room assignment exists
SELECT * FROM room_assignments WHERE booking_id = YOUR_BOOKING_ID;

-- If no assignment, the auto-assignment may have failed
-- Check if there are available clean rooms
```

### Issue: Modal doesn't close after check-in
**Solution:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify the API response is successful
- Try refreshing the page
