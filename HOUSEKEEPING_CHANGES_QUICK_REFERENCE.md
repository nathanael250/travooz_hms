## 🔐 Security Layers

### Layer 1️⃣: Frontend UI Control
```
Housekeeping tries to click "Create Task"
         ↓
    Button is disabled (gray, not clickable)
         ↓
    Nothing happens
```

### Layer 2️⃣: Frontend Validation
```
Housekeeping tries to hack modal open in DevTools
         ↓
    Red error banner appears: "Access Denied"
         ↓
    Submit button is disabled
         ↓
    Cannot submit form
```

### Layer 3️⃣: Form Handler Validation
```
Housekeeping somehow submits form
         ↓
    Handler checks: canCreateTask() → false
         ↓
    Alert shown: "Access Denied"
         ↓
    Modal closes
```

### Layer 4️⃣: Backend Validation
```
Housekeeping tries API call directly (Postman/curl)
         ↓
    Backend middleware checks role
         ↓
    Request rejected with 403 Forbidden
         ↓
    Response: "Access denied. Allowed roles: front_desk..."
```

}
✅ BLOCKED
```

**Front Desk tries to POST /housekeeping/tasks:**

## 🎯 Key Code Changes

### Role Detection
```javascript
const { user } = useAuth();

const canCreateTask = () => {
  if (!user) return false;
  const userRole = user.user_role || user.role;
  return ['front_desk', 'admin', 'hotel_manager', 'super_admin']
    .includes(userRole);
};
```

### Button Rendering
```javascript
{canCreateTask() ? (
  <button className="bg-blue-600">Create Task</button>
) : (
  <div className="bg-gray-100 cursor-not-allowed">
    🔒 Create Task (Restricted)
  </div>
)}
```

### Form Validation
```javascript
const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  
  if (!canCreateTask()) {
    alert('❌ Access Denied: Only Front Desk...');
    handleCloseModal();
    return;
  }
  
  // proceed with submit
};
```

## 🏆 Success Criteria

✅ Housekeeping cannot create tasks (UI blocks it)
✅ Housekeeping cannot edit tasks (buttons hidden)
✅ Housekeeping cannot delete tasks (buttons hidden)
✅ Frontend shows role restrictions clearly
✅ Backend rejects unauthorized requests
✅ Both roles can confirm & complete tasks
✅ Error messages are clear and helpful
✅ Documentation is complete

---

## 📞 Common Questions

**Q: Why is the Create button disabled for housekeeping?**
A: Because housekeeping staff should execute tasks, not create them. Front Desk creates the work; Housekeeping does it.

**Q: Can housekeeping complete tasks?**
A: Yes! They can confirm receipt and mark tasks complete. Only task creation/editing/deletion is restricted.

**Q: What if housekeeping tries to hack the system?**
A: Three layers of protection: UI disabled, form validation blocks, backend rejects. They can't get through.

**Q: How do housekeeping know what to do if they see work needed?**
A: The info banner tells them: "Tell Front Desk to create a task for you."

**Q: Can managers override housekeeping restrictions?**
A: No, managers have full access (same as front desk). Restrictions apply only to housekeeping role.
